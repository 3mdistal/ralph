# Agent Notes

This repo is designed to be worked on by autonomous coding agents.

## Canonical policy docs

- Escalation & routing policy (single source of truth): `docs/escalation-policy.md`
- Product vision and operating principles: `docs/product/vision.md`

## PR / branch strategy

- Prefer targeting `bot/integration` for agent PRs.
- Keep policy text centralized: link to canonical docs instead of duplicating rules across files.
